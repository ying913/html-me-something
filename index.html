<em><p>This is my friend Tony</p></em>

<p>Tony is 24 years old. Tony loves puns and anime. He also loves video games. However, he has an inability to play difficult video games like Dark Souls. He loves video games so much he injured his finger and couldn't play God of War (that was his excuse anyways).
Tony also loves to watch Asian dramas and anything related to Marvel. He especially loves Korean dramas.</p>

<p>Those hobbies make him a homebody. He refuses to hang out with his friends. He rather stay home than go out. 
Whenever friends invite him out to eat or to hang out, he makes excuses to stay by his computer. The only times he consistently comes out of his house are for Marvel movies and work.</p>

<p>Even though Tony's friends, myself included, like to make fun of him for his idiosyncrasies, we all still love him. Despite rarely coming out,
Tony is still a good friend. When he was still in SLU, he helped me feel welcomed in college when I was nervous. If I need a buddy
to watch dramas with, I know I can count on him. We can talk about video games and Asians all day. He can make you laugh when you're feeling down.
This guy will also go out of his way to help you, like helping you land a job at Caleres. 
So Tony, when you are reading this, just know that we (well, at least me) greatly appreciate you.</p>
